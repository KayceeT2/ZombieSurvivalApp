# ZombieSurvivalApp - iOS14

## What We Will Create

Weâ€™re going to make a Zombie Survival App App. You will build an app where you are in a zombie apocalypse and you have to survive by making decisions that affect your fate!

## What You'll Learn

You will review Advanced Swift, the MVC(Model View Controller) Design Pattern, Mutating Functions, and more. 

## Situations Array
```
Situation(
            situation: "Your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere! To make matters worse, you are in a zombie apocalypse. You see a zombie down the street a few feet from you, what do you do?",
            choice1: "Shoot the zombie in the head.", choice1Result: 1,
            choice2: "Don't shoot and keep walking to find shelter.", choice2Result: 2
        ),
Situation(
            situation: "Now, because of the loud noise there are a bunch of zombies walking towards you, what do you do?",
            choice1: "Shoot all of them while running.", choice1Result: 2,
            choice2: "Don't shoot and run!", choice2Result: 3
        ),
Situation(
            situation: "You made it to a house, but the door is locked. There are even more zombies coming! What do you do?",
            choice1: "Hurry up and try a window or someway of getting inside.", choice1Result: 4,
            choice2: "Run and hope to find another house or shelter.", choice2Result: 3
        ),
Situation(
            situation: "You didn't make it and ended up being bit by a zombie and eaten.",
            choice1: "The End.", choice1Result: 0,
            choice2: "Shoot yourself to not become a zombie.", choice2Result: 0
        ),
Situation(
            situation: "You make it inside and lock the doors. You check to see if there are any zombies. You decide to stay there for the night.",
